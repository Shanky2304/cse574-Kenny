    "# Programming Assignment 5 - Build your own Conventional Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this project, you will be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build neural network conveniently.\n",
    "- Configure with different regularization methods: Dropout, l1 or l2 regulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **574 Only**: Fine tune pre-trained model to build your own projects.\n",

    "# Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is provided by our current research project, which utilize 20 kHz acoustic sensing to sense ASL gestures. All the 10 ASL words perform by 5 subjects. All images are generated by using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to calculate a spectrogram as the feature representation of the reflected near-ultrasound waves. Based on the Doppler effect, sign language gestures, including both hands and arms, will cause phase and frequency changes of the reflected sonic wave. The spectrogram contains information in both frequency and time domains. The spectrogram is also defined as the Power Spectral Density of the function:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\textrm{spectrogram}\\{x(t)\\}(\\tau,\\omega)\\equiv |X(\\tau,\\omega)|^{2}= \\left| \\sum^{\\infty}_{n=-\\infty}x[n]\\omega[n-m]e^{-j\\omega n}\\right|^{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $x[n]$ is input signal, and $\\omega[n-m]$ represents the overlapping Kaiser window function with an adjustable shape factor $\\beta$ that improves the resolution and reduces the spectral leakage close to the sidelobes of the signal. The coefficients of the Kaiser window are computed as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\omega[n]=\\frac{I_{0}\\left(\\beta\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{n-N/2}{N/2}\\right)^{2}}\\right)}{I_{0}(\\beta)}, 0 \\leq n \\leq N\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset has a training set of 5,000 examples, and a test set of 1,000 examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coding checks (60 points)** - The code for your implementation should be in Python only. The name of the Main file should be main.ipynb or main.py. Please provide necessary comments in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Written Report (40 points)**: The report should be delivered as a separate pdf file, and it is recommended for you to use the NIPS template to structure your report. You may include comments in the Jupyter Notebook, however you will need to duplicate the results in the report. The report should describe your results, experimental setup and comparison between the results obtained\n",
    "from different setting of the algorithm and dataset.**Again, the questions in the Assignment PDF and here are the same (for the written report), we just put them in both places for convenience.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, you will submit, one member of your group will subit as a zip file on UBLearns, a ```.zip``` file that contains 3 things:\n",
    "- Your completed jupyter notebook.\n",
    "- Your written report."

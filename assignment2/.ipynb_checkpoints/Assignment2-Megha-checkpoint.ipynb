    "# Part 1 - Predicting Review Scores on Pitchfork\n",
    "\n",
    "For Part 1, we will be using data from [this paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/7355). The data is a collection of reviews from [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/), a site that provides expert reviews of music album. The authors of this paper have also combined the data with a set of features from [Spotify’s API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) that provide insight into the music itself, e.g. the \"acousticness\" of the song.  We will tackle a regression problem here, trying to predict the score of a review from several of the other columns in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1.1 - Feature Engineering with Feature Subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first subsection of Part 1, we’re going to rely on our old friend linear regression. We’re going to look at how running linear regression with various subsets of our features impacts our ability to predict score.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 1.1, your task is to write code below that trains a separate linear regression model for a number of different feature subsets.  Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The list `feature_sets` below is a list of lists; each sublist is a different subset of features to build a model with. \n",
    "- All models should be trained on the dataset `part1_train.csv`. \n",
    "- For each of these trained models, you should evaluate the model’s predictions on the training dataset, as well as the provided test set, called `part1_test.csv`. The evaluation metric we will use is **root mean squared error**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Write out the result to a file called `part_1.1_results.csv` and submit this along with your assignment. The file should have the following columns:\n",
    "- `feature_set` - a column describing the features of the model used. For feature sets with multiple features, combine them using an underscore (you can do this with the code `\"_\".join(feature_set)`)\n",
    "- `training_rmse` - a column that gives the RMSE of a linear regression model trained on this feature set on the training data\n",
    "- `test_rmse` - a column that gives the RMSE of a linear regression model trained on this feature set on the test data\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, please answer the following questions:\n",
    "- **1.1.1** Which model had the best RMSE on the *training data*? \n",
    "- **1.1.2** Which model had the best RMSE on the *test data*? \n",
    "- **1.1.3** Which feature do you believe was the most important one? Why? *(Note: There is more than one perfectly acceptable way to answer this question)*\n",
    "- **1.1.4** What can we say about the utility of the Spotify features based on these results?"

    "3. Scale all of your continuous features using the `StandardScaler`.\n",
    "4. Train an L1-regularized linear regression model using these features on the dataset `part1_train.csv`. You should use the [LassoCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LassoCV.html) class in `sklearn`, it will do the cross-validation necessary to select the appropriate value for the regularizer for you!  Use 10-fold cross-validation to perform model selection (set the `LassoCV` parmaeter `cv` to 10), and set the `random_state` to 1. Do not change any of the other parameters to `LassoCV` (i.e. leave them at their defaults).\n",
    "5. Identify the best `alpha` value (the regularizer term, according to `sklearn`. In class, we refer to this as $\\lambda$!) in terms of average mean squared error according to the cross-validation.\n",
    "6. Finally, train a [Lasso](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Lasso.html) model on the entire training dataset (`part1_train.csv`). You will use this to report the root mean squared error on the test set (Question 1.2.4 below), and use it in Part 1.3 below as well.\n",

    "# Part 1.4 - \"Manual\" Cross-Validation + Holdout for Model Selection and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "We will finally use cross validation for both algorithm and model selection, with a hold-out test set for a final evaluation. We will use **5-fold cross validation** to identify the best parameters and hyperparameters for a set of models. We will then take our final models and use a final hold-out test set (the same one as above) to estimate the generalization error of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, your task is first to write code that trains and evaluates the following models, one for each of the specified hyper parameters sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Decision Tree regression` - All combinations of a `max_depth` of 5, 10, or 20, and a `criterion` of `\"squared error\"` or `\"absolute error\"`. Use the [DecisionTreeRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor).\n",
    "- Ridge regression - Use the following choices of L2 penalty: $[10^{-5}, 10^{-4}, ..., 10^4, 10^5]$. In Python, you can create a list of these numbers using `np.logspace(-5, 5, 11)`. Use the [Ridge](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Ridge.html#sklearn.linear_model.Ridge) class from sklearn to train a Ridge Regression model. The parameters you need to pass when constructing the Ridge model are `alpha`, which lets you specify what you want the L2 penalty to be, and `random_state=0` to avoid randomness.\n",
    "- kNN regression - Values of `n_neighbors` of 1, 5, 10, and 15. Use the [KNeighborsRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor.html) class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional notes:\n",
    "1. All models should use the feature sets described in Part 1.3 (the same ...one-hot encoded... categorical variables, and the scaled continuous variables)\n",
    "2. As opposed to using the `KFold` class from `sklearn` like we did in class, we have instead provided you with pre-existing data sets; you should therefore use the pre-split data in the provided CSV files ``1.2_fold0.csv ... 1.2_fold4.csv``\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to submit**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write out the result to a file called `part_1.4_results.csv` and submit this along with your assignment. The file should have the following columns:\n",
    "- `model_name` - The name of the model, one of `DTR` (Decision Tree Regression), `Ridge`, or `KNN`.\n",
    "- `hyperparameter_setting` - a column describing the hyperparameters of the model. For models with multiple hyperparameters, combine them using an underscore (you can do this with the code `\"_\".join(hyperparameters)`).\n",
    "- `mean_training_rmse` - a column that gives the mean RMSE on the k-fold training data. You should take the average of the model’s errors on the different folds, using root mean squared error again as your evaluation metric.\n",
    "- `sd_training_rmse` - a column that gives the standard deviation RMSE on the k-fold training data.\n",
    "- `test_rmse` - a column that gives the test rmse of the model/hyperparameter you trained this feature set on the test data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Answer the following questions:\n",
    "- **1.4.1** Report, for each model, the hyper parameter setting that resulted in the best performance\n",
    "- **1.4.2** Which model performed the best overall on the cross-validation? \n",
    "- **1.4.3** Which model performed the best overall on the final test set? \n",
    "- **1.4.4** With respect to your answer for 1.4.3, why do you think that might be? (*Note: there is more than one correct way to answer this question*)\n",
    "- **1.4.5** Which model/hyperparameter setting had the highest standard deviation across the different folds of the cross validation?\n",
    "- **1.4.6** With respect to your answer for 1.4.6, why do you think that might be? (*Note: there is more than one correct way to answer this question*)"
